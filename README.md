# GoMatrixHosting AWX Setup - An AWX setup for managing multiple Matrix servers.

## Purpose

This playbook spawns an AWX system that can create and manage multiple [Matrix](http://matrix.org/) servers. You can issue members an AWX login to their own 'organisation', which they can use to manage/configure 1 to N servers.

Members can be assigned a server from Digitalocean, or they can connect their own on-premises server. This script is free to use in a commercial context with the 'MemberPress Plus' and 'WP Oauth Server' addons. It can also be run in a non-commercial context.

The AWX system is arranged into 'members' each with their own 'subscriptions'. After creating a subscription the user enters the 'provision stage' where they defined the URLs they will use, the server's location and whether or not there's already a website at the base domain. They then proceed onto the 'deploy stage' where they can configure their Matrix/Jitsi/Dimension/Web service.

Ideally this system can manage the updates, configuration, backups and monitoring on it's own. It is an extension of the popular deploy script [spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

This project is currently beta quality and we encourage you to try it.


## Installation

To configure and install this AWX setup on your own server, follow the [Installation_AWX.md in the docs/ directory](docs/Installation_AWX.md).

For a simpler installation guide that's perfect for first time users see [Installation_Minimal_AWX.md in the docs/ directory](docs/Installation_Minimal_AWX.md).


## Deficiencies

This Ansible playbook can be improved in the following ways:

- Can be expanded to include other sections of the original playbook, like bridges.
- Someone should fork it! :)


## Forking Notes

If you're forking this software please follow our [gitlab.com repositories](https://gitlab.com/GoMatrixHosting), our github.com mirrors are not as accurate.

Also be sure to follow the [Upgrade Notes](https://gitlab.com/GoMatrixHosting/create-awx-system/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) that are published for every release, if you don't do this you'll encounter a lot of strange errors we probably won't help you with.
