Before You Start

Some rules you should follow to have a good experience:

1) DO NOT run more then one job template at a time. This could break your server and lead to significant downtime.


Planning Out Your Server

You need to pick URL names for the following:

Base Domain – The base domain for your Matrix service, this could be your existing website or even a subdomain, this URL will appear at the end of your users Matrix IDs. For example: ‘cheesedomain.xyz’ for a user account ‘@billy:cheesedomain.xyz’.

Element Subdomain – The subdomain is where your Element client will appear, this can be any value you like, for example ‘chat’ for an Element client hosted at ‘https://chat.cheesedomain.xyz’.

Base Domain Used – You need to also decide whether to connect this Matrix service to your existing website (Base Domain Used = ‘true’) or whether you would like us to serve the base domain website for you (Base Domain Used = ‘false’) .

Your matrix service will be erected at the ‘matrix’ subdomain, for example:
matrix.cheesedomain.xyz

A Jitsi service will also be erected at the ‘jitsi’ subdomain, for example: 
jisti.cheesedomain.xyz


DigitalOcean Servers

If you’re using a DigitalOcean server the following locations will be available to you:

    • New York City (USA)
    • San Francisco (USA)
    • Amsterdam (NLD)
    • Frankfurt (DEU)
    • Singapore (SGP)
    • London (GBR)
    • Toronto (CAN)
    • Balgalore (IND)

On-Premises Servers

If you plan to bring your own server it needs to have the following properties:

    • x86-64 machine.
    • Debian 10 as the operating system.
    • SSD storage (Preferably NVMe).
    • Public SSH key added to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    • A public IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    • ~0.5mbps upload per user.

If your server doesn't have a static or public IP address, or has some other local routing/firewall issue, a wireguard server can be configured to connect your server to the world. If you think you need this service talk to your AWX administrator before provisioning.


Provision Stage With ‘DigitalOcean’ Server.

Just enter the values you’ve defined after reading the previous page and select your droplet location. A server will be provisioned for you, the job_templates you need to configure it will become available, and DNS advice will be printed for you at the end of the playbook run.

If you receive an error message claiming "Size is not available in this region." consult the droplet availability chart then re-run the provision playbook with another region selected:
https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/platform/availability-matrix/#droplet-plan-availability

If you had your heart set on a specific location contact us and we might be able to help you.


Provision Stage With ‘On-Premises’ Server.

Just enter the values you’ve defined after reading the previous page and enter the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address for your server. The on-premises server will be provisioned for you, the job_templates you need to configure it will become available, and DNS advice will be printed for you at the end of the playbook run.


Configuring Your DNS

In the output of provision stage you will receive DNS configuration advice, you must configure this DNS setup or you won’t be able to proceed onto the deploy stage, here is an example of the DNS output:

"msg": [
  "Your server has been created! You now need to configure your DNS to have the",
  "following records:",
  "Type    Host                    Priority  Weight  Port   Target",
  "A       -                       -         -       -      134.209.44.206",
  "A       -                       -         -       -      2604:a880:800:c1::181:7001",
  "A       matrix                  -         -       -      134.209.44.206",
  "A       matrix                  -         -       -      2604:a880:800:c1::181:7001",
  "CNAME   client                  -         -       -      matrix.absolutematrix.com",
  "CNAME   jitsi                   -         -       -      matrix.absolutematrix.com",
  "SRV     _matrix-identity._tcp   10        0       443    matrix.absolutematrix.com",
  "-",
  "Setting the IPv6 record is optional. If you need help doing this please contact us."
]

Here is an example of what the following DNS configuration would look like if entered into NameSilo:


Configuring a .well-known

Note: You only need to configure a .well-known if Base Domain Used = ‘true’

Please follow the steps outlined in: https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-well-known.md

Basically you need to configure 2 files on your base domain:

/.well-known/matrix/server
```
{
	"m.server": "matrix.example.org:8448"
}
```


/.well-known/matrix/client
```
{
	"m.homeserver": {
		"base_url": "https://matrix.example.org"
	}
,
	"m.identity_server": {
		"base_url": "https://matrix.example.org"
	}
}
```


With your base domains URL instead of ‘example.org’.


Deploy/Update a Server

Now that your DNS is configured you can deploy your server. Run the ‘Deploy/Update a Server’ playbook to get started, this playbook is scheduled to update your server every Sunday.


Self-Check

The ‘Self-Check’ playbook allows you to diagnose your server and see metrics for it like how much disk space has filled up and how much CPU/RAM is being utilised.


Backup Server

The ‘Backup Server’ playbook allows you to opt-into an offsite backup. For HIPPA compliance this will need to be enabled. Backups will be run routinely by the AWX administrator.


Export Server

Export a copy of the server. This copy is available by SFTP and will be deleted 24 hours after being generated.


Start/Restart all Services

Restart or start all the services on your server.


Stop all Services

Stop all the services on your server.


Configure Element

Set Welcome Page Text		Sets the text seen on the welcome page. Leaving this field blank will cause this default headline to be used: 
				'Decentralised, encrypted chat & collaboration powered by [Matrix]'

Show Registration Button	If you show the registration button on the welcome page.


Configure Element Subdomain

Configure Element clients subdomain location. (Eg: 'element' for element.example.org)

Set Element Subdomain		Sets the subdomain of the Element web-client, you should only specify the subdomain, not the base domain you've already set. 
				(Eg: 'element' for element.example.org) Note that to change this value you'll need to reconfigure your DNS first, adding the new CNAME record.


Configure Email Relay

Enable MailGun relay to increase verification email reliability.

Enable Email Relay		Enables the MailGun email relay server, enabling this will increase the reliability of your email verification.


Configure Jitsi

Configured the Jitsi instance for your server, this allows you to do group chats and conferencing.

Password		Sets the password of the newly created account.

Administrator Access	Sets whether this user account will be a server admin. Server admins can use their access tokens to run administration/moderation commands on the homeserver.


Purge Database (Advanced)

Warning: This tool may cause irreversible damage to your database.

This template allows you to shrink your Synapse database, it should be used when purging local/remote media doesn’t reclaim enough disk space. Be aware that using this tool can cause cause performance issues and will also cause your server to experience downtime.

Purge Mode		5 modes are available:
			1) No local users [recommended] - Purge rooms with no local users, if you're not sure what mode to use pick this one.
			2) Number of users [slower] - Purge rooms with no local users as well as rooms with more then N users.
			3) Number of events [slower] - Purge rooms with no local users as well as rooms with more then N events.
			4) Skip purging rooms [faster] - Skip purging rooms entirely and just compress other assets within the database.
			5) Perform final shrink - After running one of the above modes, the tool needs to be run again in this mode for your diskspace to be reclaimed. WARNING: This will cause downtime for your Matrix service, it should only be run when you are prepared for that.

Purge Metric Value	The number of users or events used to select rooms for purging, rooms with more users or events then this value will be purged.

Purge Date		The date that rooms will be purged too, the date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. (Eg: 2020-06-01)


Purge Media (Advanced)

This template allows you to trim your existing media repository, it should be used when your server is running low on disk space. Be aware that deleted local media cannot be recovered.
